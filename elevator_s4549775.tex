\section{Formal Specifications}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item %1
	Doors should not open if the elevator is not present.
	\item %2
	A requested floor will be served sometime.
	\item %3
	A requested floor will be served sometime.
	\item %4
	Again and again the elevator returns to floor 0.

	$\square \diamond elevator.floor = 0$
	\item %5
	The top-floor gets priority: when it is requested, the elevator serves it immediately, before other floors.
	\item %6
	The indicator lights are correct: they are on if, and only if, the elevator goes to that floor.
	\item %7
	If there is no request, the elevator does not move.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reflection}
\subsection{Division of Tasks}
Unfortunately I did not find a partner for this exercise. I wanted to ask if anybody else was looking for a partner at the most recent werkcollege on Friday, but I was the only one attending.

Therefore I did all the work on this exercise on my own.
